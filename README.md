# CNN Weather Detection

## Description
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into four different weather conditions: fog, daily (clear), night, and rain. The CNN model is trained on a large dataset of weather images, and can accurately predict the weather condition in a given image.
